# 04-Harden-SSH
This section documents how to change the default SSH port in a Linux System.

## Why Change SSH Port?
- Changing the default SSH port **(22)** is a common security hardening step in Linux.

- While it doesnâ€™t replace proper authentication methods **(like key-based login)**, it helps reduce unwanted noise from automated bots and scanners that constantly probe **port 22** for vulnerabilities. 

- By moving SSH to a non-standard port, you lower the number of brute-force attempts hitting your server, making logs cleaner and attacks less likely to succeed.

## What This Covers
- Changing the default SSH port (to reduce automated attack attempts).
- Disabling root login via SSH.
- Enforcing key-based authentication instead of password-based login.
- Restricting which users can SSH into the server.
- Adjusting SSH configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`) for better security.
- Restarting and testing the SSH service after changes.
