# 02-Non Root User
This section details how to add users that aren't root, into the sudo group.
## Why Create Non Root Users?
Logging into a root account directly presents a significant security risk due to the extensive permissions and potential for misuse or compromise. A compromised root account allows an attacker to control the entire system, potentially leading to data breaches, system damage, and the installation of malware. If an attacker compromises your account while youâ€™re root, they immediately have unrestricted control.
