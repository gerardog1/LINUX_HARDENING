# 02-Non Root User
This section details how to create non root users and add them into the sudo group.
## Why Create Non Root Users?
Logging into a root account directly presents a significant security risk due to the extensive permissions and potential for misuse or compromise. A compromised root account allows an attacker to control the entire system, potentially leading to data breaches, system damage, and the installation of malware. If an attacker compromises your account while youâ€™re root, they immediately have unrestricted control.
## What This Covers
- Creating a new non-root user account.
- Assigning the new user to the `sudo` group for administrative privileges.
- Understanding the security benefits of using a non-root account for daily operations.
- Knowing when and why to fill out optional user information during account creation.
